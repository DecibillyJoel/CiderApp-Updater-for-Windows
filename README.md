# CiderApp Updater for Windows
 Updates Cider on startup (for Windows)<br>
 **Notice: Please support Cider** by donating, or by buying the MS App Store version. **Cider should not be considered a "free" app**, even if you could technically use it without supporting the developers. That's just rude honestly. I only condone usage of this updater if you have already supported the Cider developers in some way, or if you truly intend to do so at a later time.<br>
